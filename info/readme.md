# Welcome to Red River Gorge

Welcome to my page. I will discuss the Red River Gorge Geological Area here.

## Some facts about the Gorge

1. There are an estimated 150 arches within the park, a number surpassed only by Arches National Park located in Utah, USA.
2. The Red River Gorge Geological Area is around 29,000 acres in size, which is comparable to roughly 22,000 American football fields.
3. Red River Gorge houses Natural Bridge, a sandstone rock bridge that is 65 feet in height and 78 feet in length.
